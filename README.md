# City prayer time API üïå

This project was done by using the open-source [Aladhan API](https://aladhan.com/) which has many Islamic API options to use in Islamic sites or sites visited by Muslims.

## What is Prayer Times API?

Prayer Times API has many endpoints that return JSON including the Five Prayers times in a specific city, country, address, or an exact month of the year.

## Timings By City

In this project I used the Timing By City endpoint to search for prayer times based on the city written.
